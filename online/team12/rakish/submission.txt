I thought the distance of each pass was the highlight of this dataset, so I
compared the length of passes (on the x axis) vs. the power play minutes
per game (on the y axis). The size of the bubble indicates how many passes
per game the player made, exact numbers can be found using the tool tip.

The two charts, one for passes made by the player, and the other for passes
received by the player, show that the better offensive players (those getting
more PP time) give and receive more passes, and make and receive longer passes.
The charts also show that the number of passes corrolate to the length of
the average pass.
